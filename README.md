Welcome to the NASA Space Image Generator! Project by Calvin, Leah, & Nathan :)

We pulled data using NASA's Image and Video Library API (https://api.nasa.gov/) for our project.

Use our site by entering in any space-related thing (i.e. saturn, black hole, galaxy) into the search field, click 'Search' and see up to 100 NASA-official space images related to what you searched, along with their titles and descriptions.

Click 'Prev' to see the previous image, or 'Next' to see the next image from the search results.

With every search, all image results display in the scrollable gallery below. Hover over any image in the gallery to zoom in.

Without refreshing the page, type in another space-related thing into the search bar, and the gallery will clear out and refill with the new search term's images.
