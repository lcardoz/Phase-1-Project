Welcome to the NASA Space Image Generator! Project by Calvin, Leah, & Nathan :)

We pulled data using NASA's Image and Video Library API (https://api.nasa.gov/) for our project.

Use our site by entering in any space-related thing (i.e. saturn, hubble, galaxy) into the search field, click 'Search' and the first 100 NASA official space images related to what you searched.

Click 'Prev' to see the previous image, or 'Next' to see the next image from the search results.

With every search, all 100 images display in the scrollable gallery below. Hover over any image in the gallery to zoom in.

Without refreshing the page, type in another space-related thing into the search bar, and the gallery will clear out and refill with that search term's images.
